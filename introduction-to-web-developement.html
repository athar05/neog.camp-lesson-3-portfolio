    <h1>A Simple Introduction To Web-Development</h1>
    <p>
      In March of 2021, I embarked on my web development journey after much
      deliberation. However, taking this step was not an easy decision at all.
      If you’ve not written code for the first 20 years of your life, like me,
      then chances are that you may conceive web development as something only
      smart people do. <br />
      <br />

      Much to my surprise, after 6 months of learning web development from Udemy
      and Neog.camp, I discovered that web development is a learnable skill, a
      very learnable skill. All one has to do is learn three tools - HTML, CSS
      and JavaScrip. We’ll get to that in a bit. First let us understand what
      web development is.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>
    <p>
      To put it simply, web development is the process of creating and
      maintaining websites, which includes various activities like web design,
      maintenance and database management.
    </p>

    <h2>What Tools Are Required To Learn Web Development?</h2>

    <p>A typical web page is made up of three layers:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A Content Layer</li>
      <li>A Design Layer</li>
      <li>A Behaviour Layer</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These three layers conjoin to deliver an experience to the visitors of a
      webpage. While there are a number of tools that can be used to build these
      three layers, the most common ones used in tandem are HTML, CSS and
      JavaScript.
    </p>

    <h3>What Is HTML?</h3>

    <p>
      Hypertext Markup Language, fondly referred to as HTML, is used to create
      the content layer of a webpage. Hypertext is a text that is readable by a
      computer, and markup language provides meaning to any given hypertext and
      dictates how it should be formatted and laid out. In essence, HTML is the
      structural foundation of a page that browsers use to display contents of a
      page.
    </p>

    <h3>What Is CSS?</h3>
    <p>
      Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is a language that provides the design
      layer of a webpage, and is used to make web pages look more presentable
      using colors, typography, positioning and other visual styles. CSS is
      basically used to change the appearance and aesthetics of a webpage.
    </p>

    <h3>What Is JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>
      Last but not least, JavaScript is a programming language that forms the
      behavioral layer and adds interactivity to a webpage. It allows one to
      implement dynamic features on websites that otherwise cannot be done using
      HTML and CSS. Using JavaScript, one can collect data, call APIs, track
      clicks and more. JavaScript is an essential tool to build modern websites
      and web applications. <br /><br />One analogy that has helped me
      understand the uses of HTML, CSS & JavaScript is as follows: <br /><br />

      Imagine a human body, the skeletal system is HTML (which forms the
      structure of the body), the skin and muscles are CSS (which contributes to
      the appearance of the body), and the brain and the nerves are JavaScript
      (which dictates the behaviour of the body)
    </p>

    <h2>Resources To Learn Basic Web Development</h2>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      While there is a lot to modern web-development, one has to start from the
      basics. But rest assured, with consistency and commitment, any skill is
      learnable, and web-development is no exception. In the past 1 month, I
      have built <a href="./projects.html"> 11 web-applications</a> using the
      aforementioned technologies, and if I can do it, anybody in the world can.
