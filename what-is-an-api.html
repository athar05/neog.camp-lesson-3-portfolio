    <h1>What Is An API And How Does It Work?</h1>
    <p>
      Have you ever wondered how your favourite food ordering apps are able to
      track the movement of the delivery executive? <br />
      <br />

      We live in a world where inter-connectivity is at its peak. We possess the
      incredible power to purchase, order or post something from anywhere, at
      any time, just at the tap of a button. But how does it happen? How does
      data get transferred at such an incredible rate between systems/devices?
      It has got something to do with APIs. <br /><br />
      API is the unsung hero of today's hyper-connected world, which enables us
      to make reservations at hotels, book flight tickets, track movement and
      stay connected more than ever before. <br /><br />
      But what is an API?
    </p>

    <h2>What Is An API?</h2>
    <p>
      Application Programming Interface, or simply API, is the medium through
      which two applications/web pages/devices/software/databases interact and
      exchange data with each other. In essence, an API is the middleman that
      takes requests from one device/application/software, and then returns
      responses from other devices/applications/software.
    </p>

    <h2>How Does An API Work?</h2>

    <p>
      One of the best ways to understand a complex topic is through analogies,
      and here is one of the most cited analogy to explain APIs in a layman’s
      language. Imagine you are at a restaurant, and you want to have caesar
      salad with iceberg lettuce. The place from where you can get the dish is
      from the kitchen. What’s missing is the critical link between you and the
      kitchen. Here’s where the waiter (API) comes in. It’s going to take the
      order from you, request the kitchen for the dish, and return it to you.
      <br /><br />

      In a nutshell, this is how an API works, it creates an interface for two
      systems (in this case, the waiter and the kitchen) to interact with each
      other and exchange data.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

    <p>
      APIs have granted us incredible access to each other, without which the
      modern tech ecosystem would be completely different. Hence, having a basic
      understanding of what an API is, and how it works, is imperative,
      irrespective of who you are and what you do.
